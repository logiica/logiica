# 👋 Hi, I'm **Trevor West**

### **Full-Stack Engineer • AI/ML Systems • Cloud-Native Development**

I build reliable, high-performance systems across the stack --- from
polished React/Next.js interfaces to scalable Python/Node services,
vector search pipelines, and distributed cloud architectures. I love
solving challenging technical problems and shipping clean, thoughtful
engineering work.

## 🏗️ Featured Work

### 🔹 Intelligent RAG Knowledge Assistant

End-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation system with pgvector, multi-step retrieval chains, and FastAPI. Includes optimized embeddings, metadata filtering, and context ranking for high-accuracy responses.

### 🔹 AI Agent Workflow Orchestration

Designed autonomous agent pipelines leveraging LLM reasoning loops, tool calling, vector search, and structured planning. Integrated with cloud services for task execution, data retrieval, and scalable orchestration.

### 🔹 Cloud-Native Distributed Services

Architected high-availability services on AWS using ECS, Lambda, S3, API Gateway, and event-driven patterns. Implemented observability with CloudWatch, metrics, tracing, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

### 🔹 Real-Time System Monitoring Dashboard

Next.js UI with WebSockets, server-sent events, and cloud event streams. Displays live system metrics, AI agent actions, and backend performance insights across distributed services.
